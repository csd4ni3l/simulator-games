Some simulator games i tried to make to get better at math and interesting concepts. 
Currently includes:
- Boids simulator
- Water simulator
- Physics Sandbox
- Chladni Plate simulator
- Fourier simulator
- Lissajous simulator
- Voronoi Diagram simulator
- Lorenz Attractor simulator
- Spirograph simulator
- Delaunay Triangulation simulator
- Double Pendulum simulator

Demo video included as demo.mp4, but the video is very choppy for some reason, even with OBS set to 1280x720, so sorry for that.

I wanted to add a Triple Pendulum Simulator but it was too hard.

The Water Simulator simulates 2d water splashes.
The Physics Sandbox includes crates, coins, and any custom SVG you want! Use w to place the current inventory item, and on the right bottom you can select new ones.
The boids simulator simulates how birds move together and you can change the weights so they move in a certain direction!
The other simulations i picked in my opinion look really cool and you can customize them to your liking by changing the variables.
