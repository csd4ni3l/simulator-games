Some simulator games i tried to make to get better at math and interesting concepts. Currently includes a Boids simulator, Water Simulator and a Physics Sandbox

The Water Simulator simulates 2d water splashes.
The Physics Sandbox includes crates, coins, and any custom SVG you want! Use w to place the current inventory item, and on the right bottom you can select new ones.
The boids simulator simulates how birds move together and you can change the weights so they move in a certain direction!
